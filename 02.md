We'll load in four datasets, print out some summary statistics, and fit a linear regression line, print mean squared error!

```python
dataframes = {i: pd.read_csv(f"data/dataset_{i}.csv") for i in range(4)}
```

Each has two columns: `x` and `y`.

## Benefits of using Jupyter Notebooks

We get to understand the datasets' true nature.

## Drawbacks of using Jupyter Notebooks

They're hard to maintain:

- code editor support
- version control
- code quality tools
